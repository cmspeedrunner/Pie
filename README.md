# Pie Readme
Pie is a simple alternate text file formatter and creator that has alot of unrestricted exporting qualities.

You will see 2 files titled with "source code", there is one, which is direct source code, a python file, which is what pie was coded in, then, there is a
syntactically highlighted source file which is in a html file. This is still source and if you wish to view the source <i>from</i> Pie then you must download this.
Pie can be compiled directly from Python as long as you download <b>favi.ico</b> and (optionally) the html converted source file. If you are running from exe, download
all as zip, unzip but keep all files in one directory and run the exe.
