# Pie Readme
Pie is a simple alternate text file formatter and creator that has alot of unrestricted exporting qualities.

You will see 2 files titled with "source code", there is one, which is direct source code, a python file, which is what pie was coded in, then, there is a
syntactically highlighted source file which is in a html file. This is still source and if you wish to view the source <i>from</i> Pie then you must download this.
Pie can be compiled directly from Python as long as you download <b>favi.ico</b> and (optionally) the html converted source file. You will obviously need all the librarys used in the project installed.

OPTIONAL EXE (MAKE SURE RUNS IN SAME DIR AS ICON FILE AND HTML SOURCE FILE): https://www.mediafire.com/file/h3ink686lqhtpmv/Pie.exe/file
